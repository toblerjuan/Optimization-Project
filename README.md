Your report should be a pdf file containing the following:
X The names and personal identification numbers of all the group members and name of the supervisor. 
• A short description on who has done what in the project.
X A suitable title and an introduction readable for a student not taking the optimization course. The introduction should contain a short theoretical background about the
method and what has been investigated in the project.
X The optimal point(s) and the optimal function value for each problem.
X A motivation for your choices of line search method(s) and stop criterion.
X A short discussion on the consistency in the program behaviour and how you have tested
it.
X A table for each problem and a short discussion on how the convergence and the solution
are affected by different initial points for a given tolerance.
• A comparison of the two quasi-Newton methods with/without restart.
• A strategy of choosing initial points and the sequence of penalty parameter values in
problem (pen).
• Optional: A discussion on how satisfactorily your program solves Exercises 7.10 and
7.20.
• A printout of a minimization with all information (starting point, tolerance, method,
number of function evaluations, etc.).
• Your program in an appendix.
